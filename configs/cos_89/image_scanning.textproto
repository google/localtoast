    description:
      "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary "
      "storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale:
      "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the "
      "noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to "
      "install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from "
      "establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to "
      "be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be "
      "broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If "
      "the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker "
      "could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished "
      "by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition "
      "for /tmp."

      "Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS "
