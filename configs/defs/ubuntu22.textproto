    title: "Ensure Apport Error Reporting Service is disabled"
    description: 
      "The Apport Error Reporting Service automatically generates crash reports for debugging. Disabling this service "
      "prevents collection of potentially sensitive data such as core dumps, stack traces, and log files."
    rationale: 
      "Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and other "
      "private material. Disabling it reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information."
    remediation: 
      "To disable Apport Error Reporting, follow these steps:\n"
      "1. Edit `/etc/default/apport` and set the `enabled` parameter to `0`:\n"
      "```\n"
      "enabled=0\n"
      "```\n"
      "2. Run the following commands to stop and mask the Apport service:\n"
      "```\n"
      "# systemctl stop apport.service\n"
      "# systemctl mask apport.service\n"
      "```\n"
      "3. Alternatively, remove the apport package entirely:\n"
      "```\n"
      "# apt purge apport\n"
      "```\n"
      "Ensure all steps are in compliance with organizational policies."
